# Capstone Project V - Database

This project highlight my understanding with SQLite and Python in database manipulation.
I have since explored this further and have created a GUI for the database operation.

## What is it? / what does it do?

This program allow the user to interact via a GUI to maintain a books database.

The database have 4 fields i.e., id, title, author, and quantity of the books the user have.

It is a CRUD program so the user can manipulate this database as they wish via the below main menu:

- Add book - The user can add a new book entry in to the database.
- Update book - The user can update a book entry in the database via the id which is shown in the program.
- Delete book - The user can delete a book entry in the database via the id which is shown in the program.
- Search books - The user can delete a book entry in the database via the _title_ which is shown in the program.

## Installation

_Python, SQlite3, and PySimpleGUI must be installed in the local machhine._

The program can be execute via the terminal.
